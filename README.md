Excited to Share My First Internship Task at CodSoft! ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve officially kicked off my internship at CodSoft and Iâ€™m thrilled to be part of such an innovative team! For my first task, I was assigned to create a To-Do List application. The objective was to build a simple yet functional app that would allow users to track their tasks effectively.
Looking forward to continuing this learning journey and taking on more challenges. Thanks to my mentors and colleagues at CodSoft for their guidance and support!
